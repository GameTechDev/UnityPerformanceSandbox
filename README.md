Unity project that can be used to learn the Graphics Performance Analyzer toolkit by following along with the Unity* "Optimization Guide for Intel x86 Platforms" article posted here: https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/unity-optimization-guide-for-x86-android-part-1

To get the most out of the x86 platform there are a number of performance optimizations you can apply to your project that help to maximize performance. In this guide, we will show a variety of tools to use as well as features in the Unity* software that can help you enhance the performance of your Unity project. We will discuss how to handle items like texture quality, batching, culling, light baking, and HDR effects.

By the end of this guide you will be able to identify performance issues and what they are bound to, key optimizations, and methodologies for good game development in Unity. First we will go over some of the tools available that will make it easy to identify potential hot spots in your application.
